# qpsolversbench

Minor utilities for examining quadratic solvers on problems from the precise package. 

Intent is to deprecate this in favor of inserting precise dependencies (or maybe a small subset thereof) into [qpsolvers_benchmark](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
